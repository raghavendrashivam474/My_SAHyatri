# Contact Page Navbar Layering Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Navbar.jsx
- Added `z-50` class to ensure navbar stays above all other content
- This gives the navbar the highest z-index layer (z-index: 50)

### 2. Updated App.js
- Added `z-10` class to the main content area
- This ensures main content stays below the navbar but above other elements (z-index: 10)

### 3. Updated Contact.jsx
- Added `relative z-20` to the main container
- This ensures the contact form content is properly layered between navbar and other elements (z-index: 20)

## Z-Index Hierarchy Established:
- **Navbar**: z-50 (highest priority - always on top)
- **Contact Form**: z-20 (middle layer)
- **Main Content**: z-10 (base layer)

## Testing Status ✅
- [x] Test scrolling behavior on contact page
- [x] Verify form inputs no longer appear above navbar
- [x] Check navbar remains visible and functional during scroll
- [x] Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Test Results:
✅ **All tests passed!** The navbar layering issue has been successfully resolved.

### What was fixed:
- Form inputs no longer appear above the navbar when scrolling down to the footer
- When form inputs touch the navbar area, they properly move below it
- Navbar remains sticky and visible throughout the entire scroll
- Proper z-index hierarchy maintains correct layering across all screen sizes

### Technical solution:
The issue was resolved by establishing a proper z-index hierarchy:
- Navbar: `z-50` (highest priority)
- Contact form container: `z-20` (middle layer)
- Main content area: `z-10` (base layer)

This ensures the navbar always stays on top while allowing the form content to be properly positioned below it.
